# Welcome to [KotobaMedia](https://kotobamedia.com)

We develop open-source tools for processing GIS open data published by various Japanese governmental agencies. We also provide [basic OpenStreetMap-based basemaps](https://tiles.kmproj.com/basemaps) for use in data visualization and simple mapping applications, in addition to [hosted datasets that have been created](https://tiles.kmproj.com/datasets) by the following tools.

## Main Tools

- [Import Japan's National Land Information (published and maintained by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Tourism) to well-known GIS formats - PostGIS, GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, GeoJSON, etc.](https://github.com/KotobaMedia/jpksj-to-sql)
- [Convert cadastral land parcel XML files (published by the Ministry of Justice) to well-known GIS formats](https://github.com/KotobaMedia/mojxml-rs)
- [Download XYZ tiles to a PMTiles archive](https://github.com/KotobaMedia/tile-download-tool)
